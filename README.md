# Week One Code Challange
## challenge one: Student Grade Generator

 This code prompts the user to enter their marks, validates if the marks are within the valid range, then based on the marks entered, it evaluates and assigns a grade of A, B, C, D, or E. Finally, it logs the grade to the console.

## challenge two: Speed Detector

This is a speed detector that prompts the user to enter their car speed.
It then compares the entered speed with a speed limit of 70. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed limit and greater than or equal to 0, it logs "OK" to the console.

If the speed is greater than the speed limit, it calculates the number of points the driver would receive based on the difference between the entered speed and the speed limit. It logs the number of points to the console.

If the number of points is greater than 12, it logs "License Suspended" to the console. Otherwise, it logs "Points" followed by the number of points to the console.

## challenge three: Net Salary Calculator
This code prompts the user to enter their basic salary and benefits.
It then calculates the gross salary by adding the basic salary and benefits. Based on the gross salary, it calculates the tax using different rates based on the salary range. Finally, it calculates the net salary by subtracting the tax from the gross salary and logs the net salary to the console.
